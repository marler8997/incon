# Information Consolidation.

### Problem

##### Learning.
Sometimes when you want to learn about something, you will find a very nice set of lessons that explain things very well.
When this isn't the case, it becomes a painful process of constantly searching for good resources and
trying to quickly scan through loads of material to find the peices you want.

If we could optimize effective ways of presenting information, and then take a set of material and present
it in the most optimized way, then humans could learn much quicker.

If someone isn't great at learning with a particular interface, the program could identify that and either help
them improve that interface and/or present them with a new interface.

##### Finding information.
Google is great, but information gets harder to find as the popularity of your query goes down.
It helps us organize information so we can find what we need, but it doesn't optimize or consolidate
for us to learn quickly from or reference later.

### Material Optimized for Individuals

The tool should keep a profile on people to know how they effectively learn.
There may be some interfaces that everyone should be good at learning through, but there
will likely be interfaces that will only ever be effective with certain people.

A tool should be able to test a persons aptitude at certain interfaces and use this
information to generate material that best suits their profile.

### Intermediate Language

One effective strategy would be to create an intermediate language.
Note: It may be nice if this laugnage can maintain a bijection between syntax and semantics.
The information will be stored using this language, and lessons or references can be
generated to suite a person's needs.

#### Example Tool
Parses information on the internet, and automatically consolidates all of it into a coherent source of information that a human can refer to. Can output:
- tutorials/lessons
- reference material

### Example Concepts to Learn

#### Math

_Basic Shapes:_ Circle, Square, Triangle, Rectangle, Cube, Pyramid

_Decimal Numbers_: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
